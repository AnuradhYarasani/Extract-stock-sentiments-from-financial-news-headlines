# Stock Sentiment Analysis

Web app which displays the daily and hourly sentiments for a stock (user to enter ticker as input).

Stock sentiments are determined from financial headlines scraped from the web.

The idea is that the averaged value may give valuable information for the overall sentiment of a stock for a given day (or week if you decide to average over a week’s news). What makes it easier to parse the website is that you simply have to add the stock ticker at the end of this url ‘https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=’ 
I hope you find this useful. All code is available in this Python Notebook. Of course, it is now up to you to decide what to do with the sentiment scores obtained! You can try doing machine learning with it if you want!
